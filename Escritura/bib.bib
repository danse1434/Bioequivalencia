abstract = {Methods for calculating confidence intervals for the mean are reviewed for the case where the data come from a log-normal distribution. In a simulation study it is found that a variation of the method suggested by Cox works well in practice. An approach based on Generalized confidence intervals also works well. A comparison of our results with those of Zhou and Gao (1997) reveals that it may be preferable to base the interval on t values, rather than on z values.},

@article{Rani2004,
abstract = {Bioequivalence (BE) means the {\textless}i{\textgreater}absence {\textless}/i{\textgreater}of a greater-than-allowable difference between the systemic bioavailability of a test product and that of a reference product. Studies to test the BE of drug products, and the statistical basis for their design, analysis and interpretation, have evolved over the last two decades. A crossover design is preferred over a parallel-group design as it segregates the inter-subject variation (which is not product-dependent) from the intra-subject variation (which is product-dependent). The value of testing two one-sided null hypotheses of non-equivalence at a significance level of 0.05, and the importance of estimating a 90{\%} confidence interval of the ratio (test/reference) of mean AUC and Cmax values, and of the difference between mean Tmax values, are now recognized and form the current standards for BE. The number of subjects required for a BE study with the desired power (at least 0.80) and significance level (0.05), depends on the expected deviation of the test product from the reference product and the error variance associated with the bioavailability parameters (AUC, Cmax, Tmax etc.) of the drug substance. At present, according to the Indian regulatory authority, the number of subjects required to conduct a BE study is 12 which is inadequate for most drug substances by the current international standards and criteria. This review expounds the foregoing principles of BE testing.},

abstract = {As the first decade of the twenty-first century draws to an end, the arena of bioavailability and bioequivalence has generated a lot of scientific, statistical, and regulatory activities and issues from the pharmaceutical industry, health authorities, as well as academia, since the publication of the second edition of our book in 2000. In particular, a series of regulatory guidelines or guidances were issued by different health authorities in the world. In January 2001, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the guidance on Statistical Approaches to Establishing Bioequivalence. Six months later, in July 2001, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) issued the Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence. In March 2003, the U.S. FDA released the guidance on Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Orally Administrated Drug Products—General Considerations. Later, the World Health Organization, in 2005, issued the draft revision of the guidelines on Multisource (Generic) Pharmaceutical Products: Registration Requirements to Establish Interchangeability. On the other hand, tremendous opportunities as well as challenges still lie ahead for bioavailability and bioequivalence in the twenty-first century because of breakthroughs in biotechnology and methodological research in medicine, pharmacokinetics, and statistics. In response to the challenges, upon the invitation of Professor R.B.D'Agostino, one of the co-editors of Statistics in Medicine, we were invited as guest editors for a special issue of 13 papers on individual bioequivalence that was published on October 30, 2000. In addition, the U.S. FDA issued a document on Critical Path Opportunities for Generic Products on May 1, 2007 to address emerging challenges and opportunities for generic drug products. The issues on the regulations and scientific issues of biosimilar products or follow-on biologics still remain unresolved. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the third edition of this book to provide a complete and overall presentation of the latest development of activities and results in bioavailability and bioequivalence on regulatory requirements, scientific and practical issues, and statistical methodology. The third edition is different from the first and second editions in four aspects. First, we have revised and updated each section to reflect recent developments in statistical methodology in the design and analysis of bioavailability and bioequivalence studies. For example, the third edition provides a complete update of the status of regulations on bioavailability and bioequivalence, especially, the guidelines issued by the U.S. FDA, EMEA, and WHO. Second, the third edition is expanded to 20 chapters, 4 chapters more than the second edition and 8 chapters more than},
